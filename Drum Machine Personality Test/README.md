WHICH CLASSIC ROLAND DRUM MACHINE ARE YOU?

A scientifically rigorous personality test by Andrew Rose

----To take the test, put both .py files into a single folder and run drum_machine_quiz_main.py in your terminal----

This is a silly little magazine-style personality quiz that I assembled over the 2017-18 winter break. Thought it would be a great way to practice my Python skills, produce a personal project to start building up an extracurricular portfolio, and experiment with webscraping (try the 'wiki' function at the end of the test, which pulls the introductory section from a Wikipedia article).
